# Analyze-DA-DE-DS-dataset
## DA-DE-DS-project data visualization
### The data from Da-De-DS shows the distribution of salaries and employees in the data analysis industry in the United States, as well as the distribution of their corresponding industries. I have used some graphs to intuitively show the proportion of data in different job categories. This project consists of three parts. The first part is data cleaning, the second part is data analysis, and the third part is machine learning
## Notebook
Here is my notebook about it: [Analyze-DA-DE-DS-dataset](https://github.com/Loganlanisme/Analyze-DA-DE-DS-dataset/blob/main/NoteBook/Analyze-DA-DE-DS-dataset.ipynb) 
## Data clean
Some unnecessary columns have been cleaned up

The column with the data confusion was reorganized

Split the content of the company's column for easy data analysis

The non-standard digital expression of a unified format
