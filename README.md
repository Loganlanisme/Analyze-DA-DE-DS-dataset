# Analyze-DA-DE-DS-dataset
## DA-DE-DS-project data visualization
### The data from Da-De-DS shows the distribution of salaries and employees in the data analysis industry in the United States, as well as the distribution of their corresponding industries. I have used some graphs to intuitively show the proportion of data in different job categories. This project consists of three parts. The first part is data cleaning, the second part is data analysis, and the third part is machine learning
